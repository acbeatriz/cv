    <h1>GC Crappy Dev Team</h1>
    <p><em>Just a few college students <strong>dicking</strong> around.</em></p>

  <p>This is a passion project by a couple of students here at <a href="goshen_college.html">Goshen College</a> in good ol' Goshen, Indiana. Here we got Ben,
    Jehan, and then finally me, Anthony. We're Computer Science and Physics Engineering students here at GC and boy are we shit
    at code. We hope to create quality programs for your own enjoyment. What these programs are, or will be, we don't know yet
    so Stick around to see what we come up with next!</p>
