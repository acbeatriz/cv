      <td>There’s a spot in Indiana where the leafy Maple grows;
        ‘Tis our dear, beloved city where the Elkhart River flows.
        ‘Tis a spot we love most dearly.
        ‘Tis a spot we’ll cherish long
        After youth and strength have faded, and the world has heard our song.
        <br>
        Goshen College ever singing, to our motto we’ll be true,
        Honor to our Master bringing, Alma Mater we love you.
        Here we learn life’s duties doing in our sacred college halls.
        First-year, soph’more, junior, senior answer “Aye” when duty calls.
        All our talents marked for service, and our hearts beat warm and true.
        Ever lead us onward, upward, ever shall our strength renew.
        <br>
        Goshen College ever singing, to our motto we’ll be true,
        Honor to our Master bringing, Alma Mater we love you.
        And the lasting ties of friendship, woven through with hopes and fears,
        May they ne’er be brok’n asunder in the distant coming years.
        Though our future paths may lead us to fair heights we cannot see,
        Alma Mater, ‘ere we leave you, loyalty we pledge to thee.
        <br>
        Goshen College ever singing, to our motto we’ll be true,
        Honor to our Master bringing, Alma Mater we love you.</td>
